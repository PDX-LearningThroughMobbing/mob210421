# Learning Through Mobbing

Driver: does all the typing
Navigator: Does all the deciding
Mob: Consults and discusses

Navigator: take us through each section

Recommended mobbing computer prep:

- Set notifications for Do Not Disturb
- Close all applications that you can
- Launch Xcode and login to GitHub
- Launch your simulator in advance

Rules (Add additional rules as a group):
    
- Be kind and supportive. Everyone is here to learn.
- Defer to the Navigator
- Have fun (this is a rule)
- Avoid backchanneling

## Mobbing Protocol
Agree to or change these durations, changes might have to be made in Mobster:

- Each turn at driver/navigator will be 7 minutes
- Weâ€™ll take breaks after 4 turns
- Those breaks will be 5 minutes long

## Project Description
Things we want to do (Capture the concepts people would like to work on or learn about tonight):
        
- Wireframing - Use swift to make a simple app
- Converting CSV to JSON
- App that cues deep breathing - animated bar that rises and falls
- Replace with circle that expands from center to reach margins

Project description (What we will do):
- SwiftUI app that shows a circle expanding with hard coded durations (4 sec up, 4 sec down)
- Also, that circle animation app can take a CSV and convert it to JSON in the backend
- Printing is sufficient for proving the conversion, data set can be simple - 3 columns with headers, 10 rows of lorum ipsum junk


Come up with a simple (can be done in an hour and a half) project that hits as many of those concepts as possible:


What done looks like:
    
    
Discuss as a group how far into the project description we want to go, and any details that we likely want to hammer out in advance.
